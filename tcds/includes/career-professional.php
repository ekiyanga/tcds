		<h2>Career Professional Editing</h2>
        <p>We provide Quality services on proofreading and editing key career professional documents such as cover letters, Curriculum Vitae (CVs) and concept notes or proposals for scholarship applications.</p>
		<p>It is key to have these documents professionally crafted as they give a first impression to the readers whether you fit for the job or not.</p>
		<p>For example; a CV is a visiting card that conveys personal and professional details to the prospective employer. Its purpose is to attract the interest of the employer to the application and thus get invited to a job interview. The employer will decide who to invite to the interview after having compared the qualifications and experience included in the CVs of applicants with the job requirements. Therefore, it is important to take care to draft a good CV that highlights the skills and experience that are more relevant to the job the young person is applying for. In this important exercise, we work with you to ensure you have a winning CV.</p>
