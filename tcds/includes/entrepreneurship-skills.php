		<h2>Entrepreneurship Skills</h2>
        <p>Entrepreneurship development training will equip you with skills to innovate start-ups and implement business projects that will enable you to earn extra income besides your salary. There are two key reasons to consider entrepreneurship skills development:</p>
		<p>i.  Employment vacancies are few compared to the number of graduates, so you may not be hired, even if you qualify.</p>
		<p>ii.  If you get employed, the salary might not be sufficient to cover your cost for necessities.</p>
		<p>Consider the example below, where a graduate gets employed to work as a bank Teller receives a net salary of almost TZS 550,000 after tax. Whereas the necessities cost is about TZS 830,000 giving a deficit of TZS 280,000 per month. See the following table. Though this is a hypothetical example, it may not be very far from the truth for an average graduate employee living in Dodoma.</p>
